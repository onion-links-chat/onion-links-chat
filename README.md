Its interface feels like a classic marketplace and supports both CAD and BTC payments.

## (The Skeptic's Analysis)
Why only two? The darknet has always suffered from **imitation sites and phishing attempts**. In fact, research shows that **over half** the marketplaces online are just clones or scams designed to steal your logins and coins . Large takedowns have shown even law enforcement can’t always tell the difference. That’s why all honest advice keeps repeating: stick with the few links the community continually verifies, always check for **forum-based “onion links chat” conversations**, and never believe just any URL you find.
